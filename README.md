The Mental Fitness Tracker project utilizes Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to monitor and enhance mental well-being. By analyzing data inputs such as mood logs, physical activity, sleep patterns, and cognitive performance metrics, these algorithms generate personalized insights and recommendations. Through continuous learning and adaptation facilitated by Random Forest and SVM, the system provides users with tailored strategies for improving mental resilience, managing stress, and promoting overall well-being. This innovative tool empowers individuals to proactively track and optimize their mental fitness, fostering a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.
